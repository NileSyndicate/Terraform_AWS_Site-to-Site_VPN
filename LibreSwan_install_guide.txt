sudo systemctl start ipsec.service 	//To start the IPsec.service>

sudo systemctl status ipsec.service 	//To check the status of the IPsec.service>

ping <Private IP of the EC2 in VPN-A>	//As we are using the private IP, this will ensure that the ping traversed the tunnel

sudo systemctl restart ipsec.service 	//To restart the IPsec service after any changes

If Tunnel is UP but ping is not working: 
a. Make sure EC2-A Security group allows ICMP IPv4 All traffic from VPC-DC CIDR 
b. Make sure VPC-AWS Private subnet route table has route for Destination VPC-DC CIDR with target as VGW 
c. Make sure the RT for the private subnet in VPC B has 10.0.0.0/16 routing to the correct ENI (with public IP address)
